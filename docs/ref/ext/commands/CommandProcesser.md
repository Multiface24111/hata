# class `CommandProcesser`

A predefined class to help out the bot devs with an already defined
`message_create` event.

- Source : [command.py](https://github.com/HuyaneMatsu/hata/blob/master/hata/ext/commands/command.py)

The class is part of the wrapper's `events` extension, what can be setupped,
with [`ext.commands.set_ext_commands`](setup_ext_commands.md) function. It adds more
hanlers to `client.events` and some more attributes to the client itself as
well. If you are using that function, then you skip the next part and go on
[Creating the event handler](#Creating-the-event-handler) part.

> The intro uses `client.commands` for adding commands, meanwhile this part
> of the documentation focuses just on the `CommandProcesser`'s capabilities,
> so we will use `on_command` here instead.

## Default setup

Adding it to events is simple:
```py
client.events(CommandProcesser(PREFIX))
```

After adding it should be shortcutted with the [`.shortcut`](#shortcut)
property. The reason of shortcutting is, because the object is an event
handler, so it's `__call__` method is already taken, but `.shortcut` returns
a specifalized object just for using it as a decorator.

```py
on_command=client.events.message_create.shortcut
```

> If more handler is added `client.events.message_create`, then it will be
replaced with [`asynclist`](../../discord/asynclist.md), but that datatype still supports
attribute lookup from it's element with overwriting `__getattr__`.

An important note might be, that [client.events](../../discord/EventDescriptor.md) returns
the object after adding, so instant shortcut is the most elegant solution:

```py
on_command=client.events(CommandProcesser(PREFIX)).shortcut
```

## Creating the event handler

Because the class has an attribute, called `__event_name__` set to
`'message_create'` means, the [`EventDescriptor`](../../discord/EventDescriptor.md) will
always pick it up at the correct place.

### `CommandProcesser(self, prefix, ignorecase=True, mention_prefix=True, default_category_name=None)`

- `prefix`

Prefix is the only required argument when creating this event. It can be `str`,
`list` or `tuple` of `str`, or a `callable`, what gets called with the
`message` and should return a prefix.

- `ignorecase = True`

whther the handler should not be case sensitive when checking the `prefix`.

- `mention_prefix = True`

By default when mentioning the client at the message's start will make the
event's parser to act, like the message's content was started with it's prefix.
But the main difference is that at this case if we fail to find the command, we
will not await the [`invalid_command`](#invalid_command) branch.

- `default_category_name = None`

The [`CommandProcesser`](CommandProcesser.md)'s defaults category's future
name. Can be `None` or `str` instance.

## Calling the event handler

### `client.events.message_create(client,message)`

We can separate the flow of the event's handling on 5 steps:
- [`waitfors`](#waitfors)
- [`commands`](#commands)
- [`invalid_command`](#invalid_command)
- [`command_error`](#command_error)
- [`mention_prefix`](#mention_prefix)
- [`default_event`](#default_event)

#### waitfors

We can wait for a `message_create` event at a
[`channel`](../../discord/ChannelBase.md). If we get a [message](../../discord/Message.md)
at the set channel, each of it's waiter will be awaited bound to it.

Take care, nothing is filtered yet, filtering out bot message authors and
channels, where we can not send messages comes only after this.

#### commands

At this step we try to parse the message's content to 3 parts:
- prefix
- command name
- content

> The commands' names are not case sensitive. The content ends at the first
> linebreak, or at it's real end.

If the parsed `command name` points to a command, then the command will be
esured. The added commands are wrapped in [`Command`](Command.md) objects.

Commands must accept at least 2 arguments, the `client` and the `message` and
they can accept an optional thir as well, called `content`.

If we did not find the prefix we move on the
[`mention_prefix`](#default_event), then on the
[`default_event`](#default_event) part.

If we found the prefix, but the command is invalid, we move on the
[`invalid_command`](#invalid_command) case.

##### Command examples
```py
@on_command
async def say(client, message, content):
    await client.message_create(message.channel, content)
```

Content is optional.

```py
@on_command
async def ping(client, message):
    await client.message_create(message.channel, f'{client.gateway.latency*1000.:.0f} ms')
```

You can add a command with just a simple call as well.

```py
async def ping(client, message):
    await client.message_create(message.channel, f'{client.gateway.latency*1000.:.0f} ms')

on_command(ping)
```

Adding command with different name is supported too.

```py
@on_command(name='pong')
async def ping(client, message): # content is optional
    await client.message_create(message.channel, f'{client.gateway.latency*1000.:.0f} ms')
```

When you add a command with just a simple call, can be conbined with adding
with other keyword arguments too.

```py
async def ping(client, message): # content is optional
    await client.message_create(message.channel, f'{client.gateway.latency*1000.:.0f} ms')

on_command(ping, name='pong')
```

You can create a container, from what you can add each command. Keyword
arguments are supported too. `eventlist` is not `CommandProcesser` specific,
so specialized exceptions will be raised only when it is used up.

```py
from hata import eventlist, BUILTIN_EMOJIS

CAKE = BUILTIN_EMOJIS['cake']

cute_commands = eventlist()

@cute_commands
async def cake(client, message):
    await client.message_create(message.channel, CAKE.as_emoji)

@cute_commands(name='love')
async def send_love(client, message):
    channel = await client.channel_private_create(message.author)
    await client.message_create(channel, 'I love you :3')

on_command.extend(cute_commands)
```

You can mark aliases as supported as well.

```py
@on_command(aliases=['pong'])
async def ping(client, message):
    await client.message_create(message.channel, f'{client.gateway.latency*1000.:.0f} ms')
```

And of cource you can pass the desired category's name, or the category itself.
With using categories you can define global checks and a default check failure
handlers for them for each command at the category.

```py
@on_command(category='general')
async def ping(client, message):
    await client.message_create(message.channel, f'{client.gateway.latency*1000.:.0f} ms')
```

Specific checks are also supported.

```py
from hata.events import checks

@on_command(checks=[checks.guild_only()])
async def ping(client, message):
    await client.message_create(message.channel, f'{client.gateway.latency*1000.:.0f} ms')
```

If a check fails, then an `int` value is returned by it what can be modifed.
Cannot be set as negative value tho. If it is modified, then the check failure
handler will be called with that value as well.

To the check failure handler always 5 arguments are passed:

| name                  | type                                  |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| client                | [Client](../../discord/Client.md)     |
| message               | [Message](../../discord/Message.md)   |
| command               | [Command](Command.md)                 |
| content               | str                                   |
| fail_identificator    | int                                   |

```py
from hata import Role, Permission, WaitTillExc
from hata.events import checks

TESTER_ROLE = Role.precreate(role_id=123456789)

FAIL_IDENTIFICATOR_NO_ADMIN = 1
FAIL_IDENTIFICATOR_NO_TESTER_ROLE = 2

async def check_failure_handler(client, message, command, content, fail_identificator):
    if fail_identificator == FAIL_IDENTIFICATOR_NO_ADMIN:
        content = 'You must have administartor permission to use this command'
    elif fail_identificator == FAIL_IDENTIFICATOR_NO_TESTER_ROLE:
        content = f'You must have {TESTER_ROLE} to use this command'
    else:
        return
    
    await client.message_create(mesage.channel, content)

@on_command(checks = [
    checks.has_permission(Permission().update_by_keys(administrator=True), fail_identificator=FAIL_IDENTIFICATOR_NO_ADMIN),
    checks.has_role(TESTER_ROLE), fail_identificator=FAIL_IDENTIFICATOR_NO_TESTER_ROLE,
        ], check_failure_handler=check_failure_handler)
async def rawr(client, message):
    channel=message.channel
    loop=client.loop
    tasks=[]
    
    for client_ in channel.clients:
        if client_ is not client:
            if not channel.cached_permissions_for(client_).can_send_messages:
                continue
        
        task=loop.create_task(client_.message_create(channel,'Rawrr !'))
        tasks.append(task)
    
    try:
        await WaitTillExc(tasks,loop)
    except:
        for task in tasks:
            task.cancel()
        raise
```

At cases, when someone should not use a command, like no permission or such,
then the command should return `True` (or any int instance what evaulates to
`True`), because then the [`CommandProcesser`](CommandProcesser.md) will act,
like there is no command with that name.

```py
from hata import Client
from hata.events import ContentParser

@on_command
@ContentParser('user, flags=mna, default="client"',)
async def update_application_info(client, message, user):
    if not client.is_owner(message.author):
        return True
    
    if type(user) is Client:
        await user.update_application_info()
        content = f'Application info of `{user:f}` is updated succesfully!'
    else:
         content = 'I can update application info only of a client.'
    
    await client.message_create(message.channel, content)
    
    return False
```

> Returning `False` is unnecesary, becuse `None` evaluates to `False` anyways,
> but it might look cleaner to return objects of the same type.

You can also add a command with more arguments. At that case a parser function
will be generated to deal with it. Annottions and dedfault values will be
picked up as well.
```
from hata import User

@on_command
async def hug(client, message, user:User=None):
    if user is None:
        user = message.author
    
    await client.message_create(message.channel, f'Hugs {user:m} !')
```

Like this piece of code generates a parser, what tries to parse out a user
from mention, name and id of the next word of the content. With using a
default value, we can make sure, that the command will be called even if
the parsing fails.

Just some bultin and hata types are supported:

| type          | description                                                                                                   |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| str           | Parses the next word.                                                                                         |
| int           | Converts the next word to int. The maximal length of converted ints is 100 by default, but can be changed.    |
| timedelta     |                                                                                                               |
| relativedelta | You must have deateutil installed.                                                                            |
| User          |                                                                                                               |
| Emoji         |                                                                                                               |
| ChannelBase   | Guild only for getting any channel of it.                                                                     |
| Role          | Guild only for getting any role of it.                                                                        |

The last argument without annotation will always mean the rest of the content
and every other argument before that will be interpretered as `str` annotation.
If you want to you can also use `*args` to receive undfined amount of parsed
arguments.
```
@on_command
async def separate(client, message, *args):
    if not args:
        result = 'Nothing to separate'
    else:
        result = ', '. join(args)
    await client.message_create(message.channel, result)
```
The parser everything within quote will interpreter as one word, for cases,
when you want to pass more words separated with space.

| input	                            | output                                        |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 'Nekos are cute and fluffy.'	    | ('Nekos', 'are', 'cute', 'and', 'fluffy.')    |
| 'Nekos are "cute and fluffy."'	| ('Nekos', 'are', 'cute and fluffy.')          |
| '"Nekos are cute and fluffy."'	| ('Nekos are cute and fluffy.')                |

You can also specify the generated parser, with using the `Converter` object.
```py
from hata import Embed
from hata.events import Converter, ConverterFlag

@on_command
async def avatar(client, message, user : Converter('user', flags=ConverterFlag.user_default.update_by_keys(everywhere=True), default_code='message.author')):
    color = user.avatar&0xffffff
    if color==0:
        color = user.default_avatar.color
    
    url=user.avatar_url_as(size=4096)
    embed=Embed(f'{user:f}\'s avatar', color=color, url=url)
    embed.add_image(url)
    
    await client.message_create(message.channel, embed=embed)
```
By default `user` search is by searching by `mention` / `id` / `name` at the
respective guild, or private channel, but they can be disabled, or some
more option can be enabled with passing a moified converter flag. When
looking up a `user`, with using the `everywere` flag as well, will generate
a parser what will request the user by `id` if not found locally.

Converter also allows to pass `default` or `default_code` mutually exclusive
arguments, which allows you for more control over the default value.
```py
import random

@on_command
async def choose(client, message, emojis : Converter('emoji', amount=2)):
    emoji = random.choice(emojis)
    await client.message_create(message.channel, f'I choose {emoji:e} !')
```
`amount` is also a valid argument, which allows you to define how much object
you want to get. Passing amount as a `tuple` with as `(start, end)` is also
supported. (`end` can be passd as `0` as well, then it will go for as much as
it can.)

Each type has it's name at the parser and also 2 more value is supported
`content` and `rest` as well.

| type          | name          |
|---------------|---------------|
| str           | 'str'         |
| int           | 'int'         |
| timedelta     | 'tdelta'      |
| relativedelta | 'rdelta'      |
| User          | 'user         |
| Emoji         | 'emoji'       |
| ChannelBase   | 'channel'     |
| Role          | 'role'        |
| -             | 'content'     |
| -             | 'rest'        |

If there is check failure handler, then must be there a parser failure handler
as well when the user did not pass enough or correct arguments.

```py
async def on_parse_fail(client, message, command, content, args):
    emojis = args[0]
    if len(emojis)==1:
        result = 'Please pass 1 more emoji.'
    else:
        result = 'Please pass 2 emojis after the command\'s name.'
    
    await client.message_create(message.channel, result)

@on_command(parser_failure_handler=on_parse_fail)
async def choose(client, message, emojis : Converter('emoji', amount=2)):
    emoji = random.choice(emojis)
    await client.message_create(message.channel, f'I choose {emoji:e} !')
```

To the parser failure handler always 5 arguments are passed:

| name                  | type                                  |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| client                | [Client](../../discord/Client.md)     |
| message               | [Message](../../discord/Message.md)   |
| command               | [Command](Command.md)                 |
| content               | str                                   |
| args                  | list of Any                           |

#### invalid_command

If set, called when a user used our prefix, but typed a not existing command.
It can be added as any other command. It's specific name is `invalid_command`.

```py
@on_command
async def invalid_command(client, message, command, content):
    #do things
    pass
```

#### command_error

Whenever an exception occures meanwhile awaiting a command,
[`client.events.error`](../../discord/EventDescriptor.md#errorclienteventerr)
will be ensured, but an another handler can be added too to
[`CommandProcesser`](CommandProcesser.md).

```py
from io import StringIO

from hata import Embed
from hata.events import Pagination

@on_command
async def command_error(client, message, command, content, exception):
    with StringIO() as buffer:
        await client.loop.render_exc_async(exception, [
            client.full_name,
            ' ignores an occured exception at command ',
            repr(command),

                break
            
            page_contents.append('```')
            embed = Embed(description=''.join(page_contents))

            page_contents.append('```py\n')
            page_contents.append(line)
            
            page_length = 6+line_lenth
            continue

        page_length += line_lenth

    limit = len(pages)
    index = 0
    while index<limit:
        embed = pages[index]
        index += 1
        embed.add_footer(f'page {index}/{limit}')
    
    await Pagination(client,message.channel,pages)
```

If exception occures at `command_error`, `client.events.error` will be ensured.
Same return applies to `command_error` as at [`commands`](#commands). If
`command_error` returns a value, what evaluates to `True`, then 
`client.events.error` will be called too, with the same exception. Can be
usefull for example if you want to show up exceptions only at a specific guild
or such.

#### mention_prefix

If our client is `@mentioned` at the start of the [message](Message.md),
we wil try to parse it to 3 parts:
- client's mention
- command
- content

If the parsing was successfull, we try to call the correct command, but if we
can not find it, we just move on.

#### default_event

Familiar to a normal `message_create` event. Awaited if non of the cases above
occurs.

```py
@on_command
async def default_event(client, message):
    #do things
    pass
```

## Adding events

The [`CommandProcesser`](CommandProcesser.md) class inherits
[`EventWaitforBase`](../../discord/EventWaitforBase.md), what means it can `shortcut`-ted. 
When it happens, a bound [`_EventCreationManager`](../../discord/_EventCreationManager.md) is
returned, what acts like a wrapper for the
[`__setevent__`](#__setevent__-__delevent__) method.

### `client.message_create.__setevent__(func, name, description=None, aliases=None, category=None, checks=None, on_check_failure=None):)`

- raises : `TypeError` / `ValueError`

This method checks 4 cases:
- is `name` `'default_event'` and argcount is 2
- is `name` `'invalid_command'` and argcount is 4
- is `name` `'command_error'` and argcount is 5
- is `name` anything else and argcount is 2 or 3

If anything check fails, you might get some nice errors, like:
- `ValueError: 'default_event' expects 2 arguments (client, message).`
- `TypeError: Expected Coroutine function`
- `TypeError: Expected function, method, callable object`

## Removing events

Removing events is on the same way as adding.

### `client.message_create.__delevent__(func, name, **kwargs)`

- raises : `TypeError` / `ValueError`

First tries to find a command with the same name. If it found,
it will try to compare them.
if removing fails, raises `ValueError`

> Compares the two existing and the passed `func`, as it would be added as
> a command. If the passed `func` could not be even added as a command, will
> raise `TypeError`.

## Using waitfor

Waitfors are implemented with `WeakKeyDictionary`. Where The values are
`callables`, which should return an `awaitable` object. The keys are the
`wait where` objects, at this case [`channels`](../../discord/ChannelBase.md).

### `client.events.message_create.append(target, waiter)`

The `waiter` is what will get called and the `target` is "where".
More `waiter` can be added under the same `target` too. All of them will be
awaited in a reversed order, so if wrappers can safely remove themselves
meanwhile.

### `client.events.message_create.remove(target, waiter)`

Same as adding but it removes the `waiter`. Also raises no error, if the
`waiter` is "already" removed.

### `get_waiter(self, target, waiter, by_type=False, is_method=False)`

Returns the first `waiter` what matches the criteria. If nothing is found,
what would, return `None`.

## Updating prefixes

If prefix is set with a callable, then it does not needs to be updated, except
if you want to update `ignorecase` at that case, If you passed before `str`,
`tuple` or `list` (yes, even at lists). 

Upadting `mention_prefix` is simpler, just modify the attribute.

### `client.events.message_create.update_prefix(prefix, ignorecase=None)`

Sets the event's prefix to the set value. If `ignorecase` is not passed as
`True` or `False`, it will use the previously set option.

## Class attrbiutes

### `SUPPORTED_TYPES`

- type : `tuple`
- elements : [`Command`](Command.md)

A `tuple` of the types, what's instances the `CommandProcesser` supports
to be added with typed `eventlist`.

## Properties

### `command_count`

- returns : `int`

Returns the amount fo commands added to the handler. Do not counts aliases.

### `shortcut`

- returns : [`_EventCreationManager`](../../discord/_EventCreationManager.md)

Normally the `CommandProcesser` cannot be used as a wrapper, because it's 
`__call__` is needed to handle the events.  This property returns a
[`_EventCreationManager`](../../discord/_EventCreationManager.md) what acts
like a wrapper for the [`__setevent__`](#__setevent__-__delevent__-__setevent_from_class__) method.

### `default_category_name` (get)

- returns : [`Category`](Category.md) / `None`
- default : `None`

Returns the [`CommandProcesser`](CommandProcesser.md)'s default category's
name.

### `default_catgeory_name` (set)

- raises : `TypeError` / `ValueError`

Changes the [`CommandProcesser`](CommandProcesser.md)'s default category's name
to the given value. 

Can be asigned as `str` instance or as `None`. If other value is passed, raises
`TypeError`.

Deletes a category from the [`CommandProcesser`](CommandProcesser.md). It can
be passed as [`Category`](Category.md) or as `str` instance.

If the category is found, then every of it's commands will be removed from
the [`CommandProcesser`](CommandProcesser.md).

### `get_category(self, category_name)`

[`EventWaitforBase`](../../discord/EventWaitforBase.md) "subclass".

## Internal

### `_get_category_key(category)` (staticmethod)

- returns : `str`

Used as a key, when searching a category for a specific name at `.categories`.

### `_add_command(self, command)` (method)
