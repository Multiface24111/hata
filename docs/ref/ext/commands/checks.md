# module `checks`

Checks provided to be used, when adding a [command](Command.md) to a
[`CommandProcesser`](CommandProcesser.md).

- Source : [command.py](https://github.com/HuyaneMatsu/hata/blob/master/hata/ext/commands/command.py)

Each check accepts an `fail_identificator` argument when they are created,
what is returned when the check fails, and then it is passed to the command's
check failure handler.

`fail_identificator` can be passed as any non negative `int`.
